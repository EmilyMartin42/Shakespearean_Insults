# Play choice methodology

The plays we chose to work with for this project are: Hamlet, Othello,
The Comedy of Errors and A Midsummer Nights Dream. When deciding what
plays to use we tried to strike a balance between a representative
sample that would best answer our research questions and a feasible
number for the time we had. Since one of our research questions concerns
potential differences between insults in comedies and tragedies we needed
a balanced sample and because there were four of us we decided to
choose four plays, two comedies and two tragedies. Within that each person
chose a play that they would be interested in reading, since Shakespeare is
challenging enough to read without the added weight of boredom.

Since marking up an entire play for structure as well as insults would be a
lot of unnecessary extra work we decided to work with an already marked up
version so we could focus on the markup of insults. We decided to use the
WordHoard marked plays, which are [freely available](https://wordhoard.northwestern.edu/userman/other-files/).
More specifically we decided to use a version in which each word was coded
with information such as lemma and part of speech, as one of the members
of the team used this project to fulfill their linguistics methods requirement.
Using this version gave us a lot of linguistic information to play with
but also made reading the plays a challenge: we had to read them separately
and then go in to add our tags.
