# Linguistic Methodology Write-up

## Emily's Notes
*These are just quick thoughts I had when I was marking up the plays, in no way a proper write up*

Hamlet and Claudius were marked 'parent-child'/'child-parent' even though they are not technically. However, since Claudius is his step-father we felt this best described their relationship.


We are operating under the impression that all the maxims are flouted (rather than simply broken) because insulting someone is a conscious act - they are flouting the maxim because they mean to insult them.

For Comedy of Errors I marked the relationship as what the person speaking thought it was, not what it actually was. I felt this was best because it represented the relationship they THOUGHT they had, therefore influencing the way they would speak to/about them.
