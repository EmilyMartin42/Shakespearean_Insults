# Linguistic Methodology Write-up


Within this project we aim to discover if there is a correlation between the relationships of 
characters who insult each other and the notable pragmatic features of their insults. In order 
to answer our primary linguistics research question, we began by marking the constituents of our 
corpus for various aspects of relationship status and pragmatic features. For the sake of being 
able to present accurate conclusions, we created a standard method of marking up the works in our 
corpus for said features. Said methods are as follows:

##Relationship Markup##
Shakespeare's famous plays regularly rely on the relationships between characters in order to 
convey some sort of emotional message to readers. These relationships can often be quite 
complicated, so in order to simply define relationships between characters we settled on marking up 
the three factors that we considered most important to a relationship. The first of these factors 
is the genders of the insulter and the insulted. We chose to investigate this factor because we 
knew from previous experience with our material that some of Shakespeare's insults are affected by 
gender. The second factor is the way that the characters are connected. We initially planned to only 
include "family" (parent and child, sibling and sibling) and "friend" relationship categories, but
felt that this did not include enough categories to appropriately tag relationships. In order to 
promote a greated understanding of the general relationship that characters hold we marked for 
familial relationships, friendships, marriage, and in the absense of a present relationship between 
characters we marked the relationship as that of acquaintances. Lastly, we considered the factor 
of the "state" of the relationship. This did not always stand out, so our general tag was for a 
"neutral" relationship. In times where characters apeared to feel strongly toward one-another, 
we marked them as having a "positive" relationship status, referring to when there is explicit 
good will towards the character who is being insulted, or "negative" for when there is clear 
animosity towards the character who is being insulted. 

Even with the simplified relationship indicators that we chose we came upon a couple of instances 
in which our factors could not be represented entirely accurately. One of these instances came to 
light when we marked up Hamlet; the relationship between Hamlet and Claudius may not be considered 
that of a parent and child to all who read Hamlet, as Claudius is Hamlet's step-father, however for 
the purposes of our project it made the most sense to mark it as such as that is the level of 
closeness that these characters hold, and the way that they interact with each other is typical of 
that kind of relationship. Besides this, there are also instances in both *Comedy of Errors* and *A 
Midsummer Night's Dream* where, for various reasons, a character was under the impression that they 
were speaking with another particular character, however it was not actually who they were speaking 
to. We decided that within the scope of our project, it is most important to consider who a character 
thinks they are speaking to/about as opposed to the individual truly involved, and therefore marked 
the charactaristics of the relationship in accordance with the current status of the assumed 
relationship. The basis for this decision came from the understanding that the relationship that a 
character thinks they have with another character impacts the way that they speak to or about that 
character, and the true identity of the other induvidual involved does not.

##Pragmatic Markup##
The other category of markup essential to our project is the markup of pragmatic features of insults. 
Again, we chose three essential aspects of pragmatics to focus on in the markup of our corpus - these 
are directness, the illocutionary act conveyed, and the maxim flouted to convey the insult to the 
hearer. "Directness" refers to the relationship between what is said and the message that is intended 
by the speaker. When an insult is "direct", what is said is meant, and when an insult is "indirect", 
there is a disconnect between literal speech and the meaning that is intended to be conveyed. 
Illocutionary acts are the always indirect, and therefore tags for this feature were ommited any time 
that an insult was categorized as direct. Illocutionary acts refer to a speakers intention in speech. 
There are five kinds of illocutioanry acts that a speaker can commit. 

1. Representative: represents a state; i.e. suggesting, stating, describing
2. Directive: instructs the listener to take an action; i.e. commanding, challenging
3. Commissive: speaker commits to taking a future action; i.e. promising, threatening
4. Expressive: expresses the speaker's mental state in relation to a state; i.e. thanking, welcoming, 
   apologizing
5. Declarative: to bring the state being referenced into reality; i.e. blessing, baptizing, sentencing

The last pragmatic feature we marked up is which maxim, of Grice's Maxims, is not adhered to in order 
to indicate to listeners that what is said is intended to be an insult. This tag is also optional, 
as direct spech does not have any conversational implicature outside of its literal form. This factor
relies on the automatic assumption that speakers will adhere to common conversational conventions, as 
most effective conversation does. We marked up instances where these typical expectations were not met.
There are maxims can be violated or flouted.

1. Quality: speakers intend to be truthful
2. Quantity: speakers intend to give an appropriate amount of information
3.  Relevance: speakers intend to say things that relate to the conversation
4. Manner: speakers intend to be clear

For the purposes of our project we chose not to consider the violation of maxims as a factor to mark up, 
because insults are typically "flouted", or intentionally constructed in a way that does not follow the 
typical rules of conversation in order to cause hearers to infer what is meant by their speech (as 
opposed to "violating" a maxim, which is meant to cause misunderstanding as opposed to understanding.)
