# Shakespearean Insults and How to Categorize Them

When first trying to categorize insults, we had to create a broad definition and narrow it down. The definition that we setteled on is, "Any form of deragatory, abusive, or disrespectful remark and/or action.

Initially, we had planned to include actions in the insults that we were going to mark and categorize, which can be seen in our original methodology document on GitHub. However, because this is largely a linguistics study, we ultimately decided to leave them out.

We understand that insults have a tendency to be very subjective. Our insult methods were ran past each of the 5 members in our group, each of which was liberally chosen. However, we are aware that there may be indiscretions between what our readers find to be insulting, versus what we chose. We tried our best to be impartial, but remember that we're human too -- there may be insults that do not show up here, and the reverse applies as well.
With that said, the following defines our five main categories of insults.

First is name calling -- this is when a character says something with intent to harm another individuals personal feelings or image. Next, we have personal attacks. Initially, it was meant to encompass only generally negative comparisons, however, we have since decided to include a more modern take on any type of deragatory statements. Third are insults on sexuality and gender. These include any insult that occurs when an attack on someone due to their gender or sexuality, or a comparison to the opposite gender with malicious intent is present. Fourth is backhanded compliments, defined as compliments that aren't actually praises, but rather are intended to diss the reciever. Lastly, we have slander. This is any form of disparaging, belittling, or diminishing speak about someone to another person, when the target is not present. 

These insults do not necessarily have to appear in any speech or line, several may happen concurrently. We took this into account whilst doing our document analysis and those that needed more than one insult have been assigned them. These insults, when assigned, were only assigned in the order as they have just been described to you. This means that there is no primary insult type for any that contains multiple -- no single insult is "worse" or "better" than any other.
