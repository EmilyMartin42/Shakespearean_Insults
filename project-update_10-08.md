# Project Update 10/08

This week we solidified our decisions on what source we will pull our base-XMLs from, 
what plays we will be marking-up, and who will be responsible for mark-up of each 
document. As our group has to incorporate some linguistic features into our project, 
we figured that the easiest way to divide our responsibilities is to have our group 
members who aren’t familiar with linguistics do an initial phase primarily consisting 
of mark-up focusing on finding all of the insults in our works, and our other members 
will be doing linguistics-focused mark-up once that first phase is complete. For 
phase-1 mark-up, we are currently thinking of having Dillon do the comedies and Mason 
do the tragedies. We discussed in our meeting that this may create an unevenness in 
our work in the sense that each member is only working on one type of play, however we 
also thought that this may have advantages because it could mean that by the second 
play they are familiar with how to find the insults that it contains a bit more easily.. 
If anyone has input on this feel free to let us know!
	We also did some planning for next week in our meeting;  our goals are as follows:
- have formulated a set of “steps” for marking-up insults (Dillon and Mason)
- push our XML files to our github repo (Emily)
- have met with/have a date and time to meet with Narae Han to check-in about our linguistics-focused research questions (Naiya)
