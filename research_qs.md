## Research Questions
The goal of our research was to identify the primary factors that influence insults in Shakespeares plays. Within this overarching goal we
identified four secondary research questions to hone in on these factors.

1) What role does insult type play and how does it influence other interconnected features?

2) What role does type of relationship play and how does it influence other interconnected features?

3) What role does speech act type play and how does it influence other interconnected features?

4) Does gender have an effect on insult type and does it effect the direct vs indirectness of the speech act?
