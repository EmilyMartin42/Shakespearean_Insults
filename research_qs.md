# Research Questions
The goal of our research was to identify the primary factors that influence insults in Shakespeares plays. Within this overarching goal we
identified four secondary research questions to hone in on these factors.

1) What role does insult type play and how does it influence other interconnected features?

2) What types of relationship state are more common for those who are closer, and do the insults they use on each other have a distinct type. Does the state of the relationship lend to distinct insult types?

3) Do particular illocutionary speech act types tend to employ to the flouting of a specific maxim in order to convey them?

4) Does gender have an effect on insult type and does it effect the direct vs indirectness of the speech act?
