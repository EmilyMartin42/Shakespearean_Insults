            <p>This project was developed in the fall 2021 semester for Computational Methods in the
                Digital Humanities course at the University of Pittsburgh. The team consisted of
                four main members and a project mentor.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Emily Martin</strong> is a senior Linguistics major German minor who loves all things linguistic
                and wanted to learn more about web technologies. </li>
                <li><strong>Naiya Odhner</strong> is a junior majoring in Chinese and Linguistics.
                    They took this class to satisfy the methods course requirement for the 
                    Linguistics major.</li>
                <li><strong>Dillon Shuster</strong> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
                    adipisicing elit. Quae nam corporis cum eaque blanditiis nulla!</li>
                <li><strong>Mason Gobat</strong> is a freshman planning to major in Computer
                    Science. He took this class to learn more programming languages as well as more
                    disciplines in which computer science is utilized.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A special thanks goes to our project mentor, Caroline Gish, and our professor, Dr.
                David Birnbaum. They have been essential to the completion of the project as sources
                from which we drew knowledge and strength.</p>
