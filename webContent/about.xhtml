            <h3 class="aboutSub">Shakespeare</h3>
            <p>William Shakespeare was a famous English playwright who was mostly prolific during the mid-to-late 1500s. Though he's mostly known for his plays, he also wrote numerous poems that reached worldwide recognition. Though his work was extremely varied, he did not seem to favor one genre over another. He wrote a near equal amount of each play, whether it be romance, comedy, or tragedy.</p>
            <p>It's said that only around half of his plays were actually saved after his death, thanks to a group of actors that participated in his productions.</p>
            <p>Shakespeare's style is commonly known as "unrhymed iambic pentameter," or blank verse. In laymans terms, this means that each verse consisted of one short syllable, followed by a stressed syllable, and it did not typically rhyme.</p>

            <h3 class="aboutSub">Insults</h3>
            <p>Insults are commonly defined as a way to speak or treat (someone) with disrespect or scornful abuse. When taking this into account, our group decided to focus only on the spoken insult. Spoken insults always have some base attribute to them, and thus we decided to categorize them appropriately into one or more of several different aspects. Each insult has a root "type," detailed below.</p>
            <section class="insultDetails">
                <h4>Name Calling</h4>
                    <p>The act of calling someone something that they are not with intent to harm their personal image.</p>
                    <p>Ex. "Thou are a pig."</p>
                <h4>Personal Attack</h4>
                    <p>The act of comparing an attribute of someones character or skill to that of something far worse or lacking.</p>
                    <p>Ex. "Thine sword skills are like those of a child."</p>
                <h4>Insult on Sexuality or Gender</h4>
                    <p>An attack on someone due to their gender or sexuality, or a comparison to the opposite gender with malicious intent.</p>
                    <p>Ex. "Thou throw like a girl."</p>
                <h4>Backhanded Compliment</h4>
                    <p>Intending to compliment someone, but doing so in such a way as to show that the held belief of them was disrespectful or negative.</p>
                    <p>Ex. "Thine dress blesses my eyes with a thinner sight."</p>
                <h4>Slander</h4>
                    <p>Any form of disparaging, belittling, or diminishing speak about someone to another other than those being insulted.</p>
                    <p>Ex. "Hamlet has been having affairs with the court cur."</p>

            <h3 class="aboutSub">Research Questions</h3>
            <p>Research Questions</p>
            <p>Our initial research questions were to simply find how many insults were present in each of our chosen plays, who was insulting who, and if there was a play type that tended to have more insults than any other. As we expanded upon our project, we also decided to include [these linguistic things.]</p>
