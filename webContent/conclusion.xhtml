        <section>
            <p><b>Notice:</b> Hamlet has significantly less insults than the other three plays that
                we had analyzed, thus this data may be slightly skewed. However, we are confident
                with the results that we have produced for what we were given. Had we included the
                full scope of our original idea, that is, including insulting actions, we believe
                that there would have been a larger number of insults present within Hamlet.</p>

            <h3>Genre and Insults</h3>
            <p>Within our research, we found there to be no direct correlation between overall
                insult count and play genre. Comedies had a total count of <b>118</b> insults,
                whereas tragedies had a total count of <b>111</b> -- a difference of <b>7</b> total
                insults. However, something that we hadn't expected to see cropped up while going
                over our data. We noticed, and subsequently determined, that there is more
                    <i>variety</i> within the comedy genre when compared to the tragedy genre.</p>
            <p>Though there could be a number of reasons for this discrepancy, we speculate that it
                could be in part due to the fact that comedies typically rely on <i>visual</i> or
                    <i>verbal</i> humor, rather than a tragedy, which typically involves a more
                    <i>dramatic</i> tone.</p>
            <p>In other words, insults are used in comedies as a way to convey humor, whereas
                insults are used in tragedies to convey anger.</p>

            <h3>The State of Different Relationships</h3>
            <p>Once we compiled our insults into data that we could understand, such as numbers and
                graphs, we noticed that a majority of relationships have a general animosity. Due to
                this, we must assume that Shakespeare rarely had the intention of using insults in
                jest. We initially assumed that this could be the case, especially in the comedies,
                but seeing as they hold a majority share in the present insults, we can tell that
                even there, the insults are meant to sting.</p>
            <p>It is worth mentioning, however, that three of the seven relationship types do have
                some positive relationship status. These are friend-friend, parent-child, and
                couple-couple. Friends insulting each other would be one case where you would expect
                to see some insults that are not meant to harm rather annoy or satirize. The same
                can be said of the other two. Only one of these three however, manages to keep the
                amount of negative equal to the amount of positive, which is parent to child. The
                other two are still overwhelmingly negative. This is where we can draw the caveat
                that some insults are jestful, but this is often a rare case.</p>
