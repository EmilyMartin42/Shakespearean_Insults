        <h2 class="subTitle">Conclusion</h2>
        <div id="notice"><p><b>Notice:</b> Hamlet has significantly less insults than the other three plays that
            we had analyzed, thus this data may be slightly skewed. However, we are confident with
            the results that we have produced for what we were given. Had we included the full scope
            of our original idea, that is, including insulting actions, we believe that there would
            have been a larger number of insults present within Hamlet.</p></div>

            <h3>Genre and Insults</h3>
            <p>Within our research, we found there to be no direct correlation between overall
                insult count and play genre. Comedies had a total count of <b>118</b> insults, whereas
                tragedies had a total count of <b>111</b> -- a difference of <b>7</b> total insults. However,
                something that we hadn't expected to see cropped up while going over our data. We
                noticed, and subsequently determined, that there is more <i>variety</i> within the
                comedy genre when compared to the tragedy genre.</p>
            <p>Though there could be a number of reasons for this discrepancy, we speculate that it
                could be in part due to the fact that comedies typically rely on <i>visual</i> or
                    <i>verbal</i> humor, rather than a tragedy, which typically involves a more
                    <i>dramatic</i> tone.</p>
            <p>In other words, insults are used in comedies as a way to convey humor, whereas insults are used in tragedies to convey anger.</p>
