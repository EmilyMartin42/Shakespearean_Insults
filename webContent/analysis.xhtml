      <h2 class="subTitle">Analysis</h2>
      <div class="text-box">
         <p> Below is our analysis and overall findings. Because we looked at so many
            different factors not all of them can be explored in detail here however,
            through careful examination we were able to pull out the factors we thought
            were the most useful for answering our four sub-research questions. 
            <ol>
               <li>Do the other features influence insult type? Specifically, is there
                  any correlation between insult count and insult type to play genre
                  (tragedy vs comedy)</li>
               <li>Is there a correlation between type of relationship and relationship
                  status (i.e is there animosity or not) and does the state of the
                  relationship lend to distinct insult types?</li>
               <li>In order to convey to the insultee that they are indeed being
                  insulted is there a particular maxim that is most often flouted? Is
                  there any correlation between maxim flouted and illocutionary speech
                  act type?</li>
               <li>Is there a correlation between the gender of the speaker and the
                  type of speech act (direct vs. indirect)? Are there certain
                  combinations of gender between speaker and hearer that lead to a
                  particular type of speech act and does it effect the direct vs
                  indirectness of the speech act?</li>
            </ol>
