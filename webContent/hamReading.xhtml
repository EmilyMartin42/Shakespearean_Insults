      <h2>Act 1, Scene 1</h2>
      <p class="stage">Elsinore. A platform before the castle. FRANCISCO at his post.</p>
      <p class="stage">Enter to him BERNARDO.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: Who's there?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Francisco</span>: Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: Long live the king!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Francisco</span>: Bernardo?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: He.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Francisco</span>: You come most carefully upon your hour.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: 'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Francisco</span>: For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold, And I am sick at heart.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: Have you had quiet guard?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Francisco</span>: Not a mouse stirring.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: Well, good night. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Francisco</span>: I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who is there? Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Friends to this ground.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: And liegemen to the Dane.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Francisco</span>: Give you good night.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: O, farewell, honest soldier: Who hath relieved you?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Francisco</span>: Bernardo hath my place. Give you good night. Exit.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Holla! Bernardo!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: Say, What, is Horatio there?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: A piece of him.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: What, has this thing appeared again to-night?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: I have seen nothing.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy, And will not let belief take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us: Therefore I have entreated him along With us to watch the minutes of this night; That if again this apparition come, He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: Sit down awhile; And let us once again assail your ears, That are so fortified against our story What we have two nights seen.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Well, sit we down, And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: Last night of all, When yond same star that's westward from the pole Had made his course to illume that part of heaven Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself, The bell then beating one, Enter Ghost.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: In the same figure, like the king that's dead.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: Looks 'a not like the king? mark it, Horatio.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: It would be spoke to.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Speak to it, Horatio.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: What art thou that usurp'st this time of night, Together with that fair and warlike form In which the majesty of buried Denmark Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: It is offended.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: See, it stalks away!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak! Exit Ghost.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: 'Tis gone, and will not answer.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale: Is not this something more than fantasy? What think you on't?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Before my God, I might not this believe Without the sensible and true avouch Of mine own eyes.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Is it not like the king?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: As thou art to thyself: Such was the very armour he had on When he the ambitious Norway combated; So frowned he once, when, in an angry parle, He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. 'Tis strange.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: In what particular thought to work I know not: But in the gross and scope of mine opinion, This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, Why this same strict and most observant watch So nightly toils the subject of the land, And why such daily cast of brazen cannon, And foreign mart for implements of war; Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task Does not divide the Sunday from the week; What might be toward, that this sweaty haste Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: Who is't that can inform me?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: That can I; At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, Whose image even but now appeared to us, Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, Thereto pricked on by a most emulate pride, Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet For so this side of our known world esteemed him Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a sealed compact, Well ratified by law and heraldry, Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror: Against the which, a moiety competent Was gaged by our king; which had returned To the inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same comart, And carriage of the article designed, His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, Of unimproved mettle hot and full, Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there Sharked up a list of lawless resolutes, For food and diet, to some enterprise That hath a stomach in't; which is no other As it doth well appear unto our state But to recover of us, by strong hand And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands So by his father lost: and this, I take it, Is the main motive of our preparations, The source of this our watch and the chief head Of this posthaste and romage in the land.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: I think it be no other but e'en so: Well may it sort that this portentous figure Comes armed through our watch; so like the king That was and is the question of these wars.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. In the most high and palmy state of Rome, A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets: As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, Disasters in the sun; and the moist star Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse: And even the like precurse of feared events, As harbingers preceding still the fates And prologue to the omen coming on. Have heaven and earth together demonstrated Unto our climatures and countrymen. But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again! Re-enter Ghost. I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion! If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, Speak to me: If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease and grace to me, Speak to me: Cock crows. If thou art privy to thy country's fate, Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak! Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, For which they say, your spirits oft walk in death, Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Shall I strike it with my partisan?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Do, if it will not stand.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: 'Tis here!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: 'Tis here!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: 'Tis gone! Exit Ghost. We do it wrong, being so majestical, To offer it the show of violence; For it is, as the air, invulnerable, And our vain blows malicious mockery.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Bernardo</span>: It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: And then it started like a guilty thing Upon a fearful summons. I have heard, The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat Awake the god of day; and, at his warning, Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, The extravagant and erring spirit hies To his confine: and of the truth herein This present object made probation.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: It faded on the crowing of the cock. Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, This bird of dawning singeth all night long: And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad; The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike, No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, So hallowed and so gracious is that time.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: So have I heard and do in part believe it. But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill: Break we our watch up; and by my advice, Let us impart what we have seen to-night Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know Where we shall find him most convenient. Exeunt.</p>
      <h2>Act 1, Scene 2</h2>
      <p class="stage">A room of state in the castle.</p>
      <p class="stage">Enter the KING, QUEEN,  HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS,  Lords, and
         Attendants.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death The memory be green, and that it us befitted To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom To be contracted in one brow of woe, Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature That we with wisest sorrow think on him, Together with remembrance of ourselves. Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen, The imperial jointress to this warlike state, Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy, With an auspicious and a dropping eye, With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage, In equal scale weighing delight and dole, Taken to wife: nor have we herein barred Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone With this affair along. For all, our thanks. Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, Holding a weak supposal of our worth, Or thinking by our late dear brother's death Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, Co-leagued with this dream of his advantage, He hath not failed to pester us with message, Importing the surrender of those lands Lost by his father, with all bands of law, To our most valiant brother. So much for him. Now for ourself and for this time of meeting: Thus much the business is: we have here writ To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras, Who, impotent and bedrid, scarcely hears Of this his nephew's purpose, to suppress His further gait herein; in that the levies, The lists and full proportions, are all made Out of his subject: and we here dispatch You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand, For bearers of this greeting to old Norway; Giving to you no further personal power To business with the king, more than the scope Of these delated articles allow. Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Cornelius and Voltimand</span>: In that and all things will we show our duty.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell. Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius. And now, Laertes, what's the news with you? You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes? You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes, That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? The head is not more native to the heart, The hand more instrumental to the mouth, Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: My dread lord, Your leave and favour to return to France; From whence though willingly I came to Denmark, To show my duty in your coronation, Yet now, I must confess, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave By laboursome petition, and at last Upon his will I sealed my hard consent: I do beseech you, give him leave to go.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will! But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: A little more than kin, and less than kind.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Not so, my lord; I am too much in the sun.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. Do not for ever with thy vailed lids Seek for thy noble father in the dust: Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die, Passing through nature to eternity.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ay, madam, it is common.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: If it be, Why seems it so particular with thee?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not “ seems.” 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, Nor customary suits of solemn black, Nor windy suspiration of forced breath, No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, Nor the dejected “ haviour of the visage, Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, That can denote me truly: these indeed seem, For they are actions that a man might play: But I have that within which passes show; These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: 'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, To give these mourning duties to your father: But, you must know, your father lost a father; That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound In filial obligation for some term To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever In obstinate condolement is a course Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief; It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, A heart unfortified, or mind impatient, An understanding simple and unschooled: For what we know must be and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sense, Why should we in our peevish opposition Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, To reason most absurd; whose common theme Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first corse till he that died to-day, “ This must be so.” We pray you, throw to earth This unprevailing woe, and think of us As of a father: for let the world take note, You are the most immediate to our throne; And with no less nobility of love Than that which dearest father bears his son, Do I impart toward you. For your intent In going back to school in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire: And we beseech you, bend you to remain Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye, Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet: I pray thee, stay with us: go not to Wittenberg.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply: Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come; This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof, No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day, But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, And the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again, Respeaking earthly thunder. Come away. Exeunt all but Hamlet.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O, that this too too sallied flesh would melt, Thaw and resolve itself into a dew! Or that the Everlasting had not fixed His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God! How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable, Seem to me all the uses of this world! Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden, That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature Possess it merely. That it should come to this! But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two: So excellent a king; that was, to this, Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother That he might not beteem the winds of heaven Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! Must I remember? why, she should hang on him, As if increase of appetite had grown By what it fed on: and yet, within a month Let me not think on't — Frailty, thy name is woman! A little month, or ere those shoes were old With which she followed my poor father's body, Like Niobe, all tears: why she, even she O God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason, Would have mourned longer — married with my uncle, My father's brother, but no more like my father Than I to Hercules: within a month: Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, She married. O, most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! It is not nor it cannot come to good: But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue. Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Hail to your lordship!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I am glad to see you well: Horatio, or I do forget myself.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you: And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: My good lord</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir. But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: A truant disposition, good my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I would not hear your enemy say so, Nor shall you do mine ear that violence, To make it truster of your own report Against yourself: I know you are no truant. But what is your affair in Elsinore? We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I prithee, do not mock me, fellow student; I think it was to see my mother's wedding.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables. Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio! My father! methinks I see my father.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Where, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: In my mind's eye, Horatio.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: I saw him once; he was a goodly king.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: He was a man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Saw? who?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: My lord, the king your father.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: The king my father?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Season your admiration for a while With an attent ear, till I may deliver, Upon the witness of these gentlemen, This marvel to you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: For God's love, let me hear.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Two nights together had these gentlemen, Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch, In the dead waste and middle of the night, Been thus encountered. A figure like your father, Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe, Appears before them, and with solemn march Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walked By their oppressed and fear-surprised eyes, Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled Almost to jelly with the act of fear, Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did; And I with them the third night kept the watch: Where, as they had delivered, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes: I knew your father; These hands are not more like.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: But where was this?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: My lord, upon the platform where we watch.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Did you not speak to it?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: My lord, I did; But answer made it none: yet once methought It lifted up it head and did address Itself to motion, like as it would speak; But even then the morning cock crew loud, And at the sound it shrunk in haste away, And vanished from our sight.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: 'Tis very strange.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: As I do live, my honoured lord, 'tis true; And we did think it writ down in our duty To let you know of it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me. Hold you the watch to-night?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus and Bernardo</span>: We do, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Armed, say you?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus and Bernardo</span>: Armed, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: From top to toe?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus and Bernardo</span>: My lord, from head to foot.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Then saw you not his face?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What, looked he frowningly?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Pale or red?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Nay, very pale.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: And fixed his eyes upon you?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Most constantly.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I would I had been there.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: It would have much amazed you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Very like, very like. Stayed it long?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus and Bernardo</span>: Longer, longer.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Not when I saw't.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: His beard was grizzled, no?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: It was, as I have seen it in his life, A sable silvered.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I will watch to-night; Perchance 'twill walk again.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: I warrant it will.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: If it assume my noble father's person, I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all, If you have hitherto concealed this sight, Let it be tenable in your silence still; And whatsoever else shall hap to-night, Give it an understanding, but no tongue: I will requite your loves. So, fare you well: Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve, I'll visit you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">All</span>: Our duty to your honour.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Your loves, as mine to you: farewell. Exeunt all but Hamlet. My father's spirit in arms! all is not well; I doubt some foul play: would the night were come! Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise, Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes. Exit.</p>
      <h2>Act 1, Scene 3</h2>
      <p class="stage">A room in Polonius' house.</p>
      <p class="stage">Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: My necessaries are embarked: farewell: And, sister, as the winds give benefit And convey is assistant, do not sleep, But let me hear from you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Do you doubt that?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour, Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood, A violet in the youth of primy nature, Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting, The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: No more but so?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Think it no more: For nature, crescent, does not grow alone In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes, The inward service of the mind and soul Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now, And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch The virtue of his will: but you must fear, His greatness weighed, his will is not his own; For he himself is subject to his birth: He may not, as unvalued persons do, Carve for himself; for on his choice depends The safety and health of this whole state; And therefore must his choice be circumscribed Unto the voice and yielding of that body Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you, It fits your wisdom so far to believe it As he in his particular act and place May give his saying deed; which is no further Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal. Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain, If with too credent ear you list his songs, Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open To his unmastered importunity. Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister, And keep you in the rear of your affection, Out of the shot and danger of desire. The chariest maid is prodigal enough, If she unmask her beauty to the moon: Virtue itself scapes not calumnious strokes: The canker galls the infants of the spring, Too oft before their buttons be disclosed, And in the morn and liquid dew of youth Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then; best safety lies in fear: Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: I shall the effect of this good lesson keep, As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother, Do not, as some ungracious pastors do, Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven; Whiles, like a puffed and reckless libertine, Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads, And recks not his own rede.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: O, fear me not. I stay too long: but here my father comes. Enter POLONIUS. A double blessing is a double grace; Occasion smiles upon a second leave.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame! The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail, And you are stayed for. There; my blessing with thee! And these few precepts in thy memory Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any unproportioned thought his act. Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel; But do not dull thy palm with entertainment Of each new-hatched, unfledged courage. Beware Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in, Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee. Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice; Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgement. Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man, And they in France of the best rank and station Are of a most select and generous chief in that. Neither a borrower nor a lender be; For loan oft loses both itself and friend, And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry. This above all: to thine own self be true, And it must follow, as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: The time invests you; go; your servants tend.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well What I have said to you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: 'Tis in my memory locked, And you yourself shall keep the key of it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Farewell. Exit.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Marry, well bethought: 'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late Given private time to you; and you yourself Have of your audience been most free and bounteous: If it be so, as so 'tis put on me, And that in way of caution, I must tell you, You do not understand yourself so clearly As it behooves my daughter and your honour. What is between you? give me up the truth.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders Of his affection to me.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl, Unsifted in such perilous circumstance. Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: I do not know, my lord, what I should think.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Marry, I will teach you: think yourself a baby; That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay, Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly; Or not to crack the wind of the poor phrase, Wringing it thus you'll tender me a fool.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: My lord, he hath importuned me with love In honourable fashion.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord, With almost all the holy vows of heaven.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know, When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter, Giving more light than heat, extinct in both, Even in their promise, as it is a-making, You must not take for fire. From this time Be something scanter of your maiden presence; Set your entreatments at a higher rate Than a command to parle. For Lord Hamlet, Believe so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walk Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia, Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers, Not of that dye which their investments show, But mere implorators of unholy suits, Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth, Have you so slander any moment leisure, As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet. Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: I shall obey, my lord. Exeunt.</p>
      <h2>Act 1, Scene 4</h2>
      <p class="stage">The platform.</p>
      <p class="stage">Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: It is a nipping and an eager air.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What hour now?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: I think it lacks of twelve.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: No, it is struck.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Indeed? I heard it not: it then draws near the season Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk. A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot
         off, within. What does this mean, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse, Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels; And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down, The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his pledge.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Is it a custom?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ay, marry, is't: But to my mind, though I am native here And to the manner born, it is a custom More honoured in the breach than the observance. This heavy-headed revel east and west Makes us traduced and taxed of other nations: They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase Soil our addition; and indeed it takes From our achievements, though performed at height, The pith and marrow of our attribute. So, oft it chances in particular men, That for some vicious mole of nature in them, As, in their birth — wherein they are not guilty, Since nature cannot choose his origin By their o'ergrowth of some complexion, Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason, Or by some habit that too much o'erleavens The form of plausive manners, that these men, Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect, Being nature's livery, or fortune's star, his virtues else be they as pure as grace, As infinite as man may undergo Shall in the general censure take corruption From that particular fault: the dram of evil Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his own scandal.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Look, my lord, it comes! Enter Ghost.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Angels and ministers of grace defend us! Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned, Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, Be thy intents wicked or charitable, Thou comest in such a questionable shape That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet, King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me! Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death, Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre, Wherein we saw thee quietly inurned, Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws, To cast thee up again. What may this mean, That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, Making night hideous; and we fools of nature So horridly to shake our disposition With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls? Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do? Ghost beckons Hamlet.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: It beckons you to go away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Look, with what courteous action It waves you to a more removed ground: But do not go with it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: No, by no means.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: It will not speak; then I will follow it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Do not, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why, what should be the fear? I do not set my life at a pin's fee; And for my soul, what can it do to that, Being a thing immortal as itself? It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord, Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff That beetles o'er his base into the sea, And there assume some other horrible form, Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason And draw you into madness? think of it: The very place puts toys of desperation, Without more motive, into every brain That looks so many fathoms to the sea And hears it roar beneath.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: It waves me still. Go on; I'll follow thee.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: You shall not go, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Hold off your hands.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Be ruled; you shall not go.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: My fate cries out, And makes each petty artery in this body As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve. Still am I called. Unhand me, gentlemen. By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me! I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee. Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: He waxes desperate with imagination.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Have after. To what issue will this come?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Heaven will direct it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Nay, let's follow him. Exeunt.</p>
      <h2>Act 1, Scene 5</h2>
      <p class="stage">Another part of the platform.</p>
      <p class="stage">Enter GHOST and HAMLET.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Whither wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ghost</span>: Mark me.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I will.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ghost</span>: My hour is almost come, When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames Must render up myself.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Alas, poor ghost!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ghost</span>: Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall unfold.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Speak; I am bound to hear.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ghost</span>: So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ghost</span>: I am thy father's spirit, Doomed for a certain term to walk the night, And for the day confined to fast in fires, Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my prison-house, I could a tale unfold whose lightest word Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres, Thy knotted and combined locks to part And each particular hair to stand an end, Like quills upon the fearful porpentine: But this eternal blazon must not be To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list! If thou didst ever thy dear father love</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O God!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ghost</span>: Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Murder!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ghost</span>: Murder most foul, as in the best it is; But this most foul, strange and unnatural.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift As meditation or the thoughts of love, May sweep to my revenge.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ghost</span>: I find thee apt; And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf, Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear: 'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard, A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark Is by a forged process of my death Rankly abused; but know, thou noble youth, The serpent that did sting thy father's life Now wears his crown.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O my prophetic soul! My uncle!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ghost</span>: Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast, With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts, O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power So to seduce! — won to his shameful lust The will of my most seeming virtuous queen: O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there! From me, whose love was of that dignity That it went hand in hand even with the vow I made to her in marriage, and to decline Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor To those of mine! But virtue, as it never will be moved, Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven, So lust, though to a radiant angel linked, Will sate itself in a celestial bed, And prey on garbage. But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air; Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard, My custom always of the afternoon, Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole, With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial, And in the porches of my ears did pour The leperous distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with blood of man That swift as quicksilver it courses through The natural gates and alleys of the body, And with a sudden vigour it doth posset And curd, like eager droppings into milk, The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine; And a most instant tetter barked about, Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust, All my smooth body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatched: Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin, Unhouseled, disappointed, unaneled, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head: O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible! If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not; Let not the royal bed of Denmark be A couch for luxury and damned incest. But, howsoever thou pursues this act, Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge, To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once! The glow-worm shows the matin to be near, And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire: Adieu, adieu, adieu, remember me. Exit.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else? And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart; And you, my sinews, grow not instant old, But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee! Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat In this distracted globe. Remember thee! Yea, from the table of my memory I'll wipe away all trivial fond records, All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past, That youth and observation copied there; And thy commandment all alone shall live Within the book and volume of my brain, Unmixed with baser matter: yes, by heaven! O most pernicious woman! O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain! My tables, — meet it is I set it down, That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain; At least I am sure it may be so in Denmark: Writing. So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word; It is “ Adieu, adieu! remember me.” I have sworn't.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus and Horatio</span>: Within My lord, my lord,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Lord Hamlet,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Heaven secure him!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: So be it!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come. Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: How is't, my noble lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: What news, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O, wonderful!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Good my lord, tell it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: No; you will reveal it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Not I, my lord, by heaven.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Nor I, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: How say you, then; would heart of man once think it? But you'll be secret?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus and Horatio</span>: Ay, by heaven, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark But he's an arrant knave.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave To tell us this.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why, right; you are in the right; And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands and part: You, as your business and desire shall point you; For every man hath business and desire, Such as it is; and for my own poor part, I will go pray.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I am sorry they offend you, heartily; Yes, 'faith, heartily.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: There's no offence, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio, And much offence too. Touching this vision here, It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you: For your desire to know what is between us, o'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends, As you are friends, scholars and soldiers, Give me one poor request.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: What is't, my lord? we will.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Never make known what you have seen to-night.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus and Horatio</span>: My lord, we will not.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Nay, but swear't.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: In faith, My lord, not I.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: Nor I, my lord, in faith.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Upon my sword.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Marcellus</span>: We have sworn, my lord, already.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ghost</span>: Swear.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny? Come on — you hear this fellow in the cellarage Consent to swear.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Propose the oath, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Never to speak of this that you have seen, Swear by my sword.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ghost</span>: Swear.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground. Come hither, gentlemen, And lay your hands again upon my sword: Swear by my sword Never to speak of this that you have heard,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ghost</span>: Swear by his sword.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast? A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: And therefore as a stranger give it welcome. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come; Here, as before, never, so help you mercy, How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself, As I perchance hereafter shall think meet To put an antic disposition on, That you, at such times seeing me, never shall, With arms encumbered thus, or this headshake, Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase, As “ Well, well, we know,” or “ We could, an if we would,” Or “ If we list to speak,” or “ There be, an if they might,” Or such ambiguous giving out, to note That you know aught of me: this do swear, So grace and mercy at your most need help you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ghost</span>: Swear.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Rest, rest, perturbed spirit! They swear. So, gentlemen, With all my love I do commend me to you: And what so poor a man as Hamlet is May do, to express his love and friending to you, God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together; And still your fingers on your lips, I pray. The time is out of joint: O cursed spite, That ever I was born to set it right! Nay, come, let's go together. Exeunt.</p>
      <h2>Act 2, Scene 1</h2>
      <p class="stage">A room in Polonius' house.</p>
      <p class="stage">Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Reynaldo</span>: I will, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo, Before you visit him, to make inquire Of his behaviour.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Reynaldo</span>: My lord, I did intend it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir, Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris; And how, and who, what means, and where they keep, What company, at what expense; and finding By this encompassment and drift of question That they do know my son, come you more nearer Than your particular demands will touch it: Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him; As thus, “ I know his father and his friends, And in part him:” do you mark this, Reynaldo?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Reynaldo</span>: Ay, very well, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: “ And in part him; but you may say “ not well: But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild; Addicted so and so:” and there put on him What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank As may dishonour him; take heed of that; But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips As are companions noted and most known To youth and liberty.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Reynaldo</span>: As gaming, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling, Drabbing: you may go so far.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Reynaldo</span>: My lord, that would dishonour him.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: 'Faith, as you may season it in the charge. You must not put another scandal on him, That he is open to incontinency; That's not my meaning; but breathe his faults so quaintly That they may seem the taints of liberty, The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind, A savageness in unreclaimed blood, Of general assault.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Reynaldo</span>: But, my good lord,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Wherefore should you do this?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Reynaldo</span>: Ay, my lord, I would know that.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Marry, sir, here's my drift; And, I believe, it is a fetch of wit: You laying these slight sullies on my son, As 'twere a thing a little soiled wi' the working, Mark you, Your party in converse, him you would sound, Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured He closes with you in this consequence; “ Good sir,” or so, or “ friend,” or “ gentleman,” According to the phrase or the addition Of man and country.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Reynaldo</span>: Very good, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: And then, sir, does 'a this, 'a does what was I about to say? By the mass, I was about to say something: where did I leave?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Reynaldo</span>: At “ closes in the consequence.”</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: At “ closes in the consequence,” ay, marry; He closes thus: “ I know the gentleman; I saw him yesterday, or t' other day, Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say, There was 'a gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse; There falling out at tennis:” or perchance, “ I saw him enter such a house of sale,” Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth. See you now; Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth: And thus do we of wisdom and of reach, With windlasses and with assays of bias, By indirections find directions out: So by my former lecture and advice, Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Reynaldo</span>: My lord, I have.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: God buy ye; fare ye well.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Reynaldo</span>: Good my lord!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Observe his inclination in yourself.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Reynaldo</span>: I shall, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: And let him ply his music.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Reynaldo</span>: Well, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Farewell! Exit Reynaldo. Enter OPHELIA. How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: With what, i' the name of God?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced; No hat upon his head; his stockings fouled, Ungartered, and down-gyved to his ancle; Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other; And with a look so piteous in purport As if he had been loosed out of hell To speak of horrors, he comes before me.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Mad for thy love?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: My lord, I do not know; But truly, I do fear it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: What said he?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: He took me by the wrist and held me hard; Then goes he to the length of all his arm; And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow, He falls to such perusal of my face As he would draw it. Long stayed he so; At last, a little shaking of mine arm And thrice his head thus waving up and down, He raised a sigh so piteous and profound As it did seem to shatter all his bulk And end his being: that done, he lets me go: And, with his head over his shoulder turned, He seemed to find his way without his eyes; For out a' doors he went without their helps, And, to the last, bended their light on me.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Come, go with me: I will go seek the king. This is the very ecstasy of love, Whose violent property fordoes itself And leads the will to desperate undertakings As oft as any passions under heaven That does afflict our natures. I am sorry. What, have you given him any hard words of late?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: No, my good lord, but, as you did command, I did repel his letters and denied His access to me.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: That hath made him mad. I am sorry that with better heed and judgement I had not quoted him: I feared he did but trifle, And meant to wrack thee; but, beshrew my jealousy! By heaven, it is as proper to our age To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions As it is common for the younger sort To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king: This must be known; which, being kept close, might move More grief to hide than hate to utter love. Come.</p>
      <h2>Act 2, Scene 2</h2>
      <p class="stage">A room in the castle.</p>
      <p class="stage">Enter KING, QUEEN, ROSENCRANTZ,  GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern! Moreover that we much did long to see you, The need we have to use you did provoke Our hasty sending. Something have you heard Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it, Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was. What it should be, More than his father's death, that thus hath put him So much from the understanding of himself, I cannot dream of: I entreat you both, That, being of so young days brought up with him, And sith so neighboured to his youth and haviour, That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time: so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather, So much as from occasion you may glean, Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus, That, opened, lies within our remedy.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Good gentlemen, he hath much talked of you; And sure I am two men there is not living To whom he more adheres. If it will please you To show us so much gentry and good will As to expend your time with us awhile, For the supply and profit of our hope, Your visitation shall receive such thanks As fits a king's remembrance.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Both your majesties Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: But we both obey, And here give up ourselves, in the full bent To lay our service freely at your feet, To be commanded.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz: And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son. Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: Heavens make our presence and our practices Pleasant and helpful to him!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Ay, amen! Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some Attendants. Enter POLONIUS.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, Are joyfully returned.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Thou still hast been the father of good news.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege, I hold my duty, as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious king: And I do think, or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do, that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Give first admittance to the ambassadors; My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in. Exit Polonius. He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found The head and source of all your son's distemper.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: I doubt it is no other but the main; His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Well, we shall sift him. Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS. Welcome,
         my good friends! Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Voltimand</span>: Most fair return of greetings and desires. Upon our first, he sent out to suppress His nephew's levies; which to him appeared To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack; But, better looked into, he truly found It was against your highness: whereat grieved, That so his sickness, age and impotence Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys; Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine Makes vow before his uncle never more To give the assay of arms against your majesty. Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, Gives him threescore thousand crowns in annual fee, And his commission to employ those soldiers, So levied as before, against the Polack: With an entreaty, herein further shown, Giving a paper. That it might please you to give quiet pass Through your dominions for this enterprise, On such regards of safety and allowance As therein are set down.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: It likes us well; And at our more considered time we'll read, Answer, and think upon this business. Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour: Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together: Most welcome home! Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: This business is well ended. My liege, and madam, to expostulate What majesty should be, what duty is, Why day is day, night night, and time is time, Were nothing but to waste night, day and time. Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit, And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes, I will be brief: your noble son is mad: Mad call I it; for, to define true madness, What is't but to be nothing else but mad? But let that go.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: More matter, with less art.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Madam, I swear I use no art at all. That he's mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity; And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure; But farewell it, for I will use no art. Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains That we find out the cause of this effect, Or rather say, the cause of this defect, For this effect defective comes by cause: Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend. I have a daughter — have while she is mine Who, in her duty and obedience, mark, Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise. “ To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most beautified Ophelia,” — That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; “ beautified ” is a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus: “ In her excellent white bosom, these, etc. ”</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Came this from Hamlet to her?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful. “ O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu. “ Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him, HAMLET. This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me, And more above, hath his solicitings, As they fell out by time, by means and place, All given to mine ear.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: But how hath she Received his love?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: What do you think of me?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: As of a man faithful and honourable.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: I would fain prove so. But what might you think, When I had seen this hot love on the wing As I perceived it, I must tell you that, Before my daughter told me — what might you, Or my dear majesty your queen here, think, If I had played the desk or table-book, Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb, Or looked upon this love with idle sight; What might you think? No, I went round to work, And my young mistress thus I did bespeak: “ Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star; This must not be:” and then I prescripts gave her, That she should lock herself from his resort, Admit no messengers, receive no tokens. Which done, she took the fruits of my advice; And he repelled, a short tale to make Fell into a sadness, then into a fast, Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, Into the madness wherein now he raves, And all we mourn for.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Do you think 'tis this?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: It may be, very like.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Hath there been such a time I would fain know that That I have positively said “ 'Tis so,” When it proved otherwise?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Not that I know.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Take this from this, if this be otherwise: If circumstances lead me, I will find Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed Within the centre.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: How may we try it further?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: You know, sometimes he walks four hours together Here in the lobby.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: So he does indeed.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him: Be you and I behind an arras then; Mark the encounter: if he love her not And be not from his reason fall'n thereon, Let me be no assistant for a state, But keep a farm and carters.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: We will try it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Away, I do beseech you, both away: I'll board him presently. Exeunt King, Queen, and Attendants. Enter HAMLET, reading. O, give me leave: How does my good Lord Hamlet?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Well, God-a-mercy.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Do you know me, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Not I, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Then I would you were so honest a man.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Honest, my lord!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man picked out of ten thousand.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: That's very true, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a good kissing carrion, Have you a daughter?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: I have, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing: but as your daughter may conceive. Friend, look to't.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter: yet he knew me not at first; 'a said I was a fishmonger: 'a is far gone; and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for love; very near this. I'll speak to him again. What do you read, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Words, words, words.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: What is the matter, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Between who?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here that old men have grey beards, that their faces are wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for yourself, sir, shall grow old as I am, if like a crab you could go backward.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Though this be madness, yet there is method in't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Into my grave.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Indeed, that's out of the air. How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between him and my daughter. My lord, I will take my leave of you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: You cannot take from me any thing that I will not more willingly part withal: except my life, except my life, except my life.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Fare you well, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: These tedious old fools!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: God save you, sir!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: My honoured lord!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: My most dear lord!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do you both?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: As the indifferent children of the earth.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: Happy, in that we are not overhappy; On fortune's cap we are not the very button.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Nor the soles of her shoe?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Neither, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: 'Faith, her privates we.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she is a strumpet. What news?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: None, my lord, but the world's grown honest.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true. Let me question more in particular: what have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison hither?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: Prison, my lord!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Denmark's a prison.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Then is the world one.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: We think not so, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your mind.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: A dream itself is but a shadow.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</span>: We'll wait upon you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, come deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: What should we say, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen have sent for you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: To what end, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer can charge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent for, or no?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: What say you?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Nay, then, I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold not off.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: My lord, we were sent for.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no feather. I have of late — but wherefore I know not lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not me: nor women neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why did ye laugh then, when I said “ man delights not me ”?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they coming, to offer you service.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty shall have tribute on me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle a' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are they?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Even those you were wont to take such delight in, the tragedians of the city.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: How chances it they travel? their residence, both in reputation and profit, was better both ways.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? are they so followed?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: No, indeed, are they not.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: How comes it? do they grow rusty?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the fashion, and so berattle the common stages — so they call them that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players as it is most like, if their means are no better their writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their own succession?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: 'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid for argument, unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the question.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Is't possible?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: O, there has been much throwing about of brains.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Do the boys carry it away?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark, and those that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find it out.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: There are the players.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you, must show fairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: In what, my dear lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Well be with you, gentlemen!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling-clouts.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Happily he is the second time come to them; for they say an old man is twice a child.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it. You say right, sir: a' Monday morning; 'twas then indeed.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: My lord, I have news to tell you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: The actors are come hither, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Buzz, buzz!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Upon my honour,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Then came each actor on his ass,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: What a treasure had he, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Still on my daughter.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing well.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Nay, that follows not.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: What follows then, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why, “ As by lot, God wot,” and then, you know, “ It came to pass, as most like it was,” the first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look, where my abridgement comes. You are welcome, masters; welcome all. I am glad to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, old friend! Why, thy face is valanced since I saw thee last: comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like a piece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see: we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste of your quality; come, a passionate speech.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Player</span>: What speech, my good lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas caviare to the general: but it was — as I received it, and others, whose judgements in such matters cried in the top of mine — an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indict the author of affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in't I chiefly loved: 'twas AEneas' tale to Dido; and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin at this line: let me see, let me see 'tis not so: it begins with Pyrrhus: So, proceed you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: 'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Player</span>: </p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: This is too long.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee, say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Player</span>: </p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: “ The mobled queen?”</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: That's good; “ mobled queen ” is good.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Player</span>: </p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has tears in's eyes. Prithee, no more.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: 'Tis well; I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon. Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the time: after your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: My lord, I will use them according to their desert.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: God's bodkin, man, much better: use every man after his desert, and who shall scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Come, sirs.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow. Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the Murder of Gonzago?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Player</span>: Ay, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for need, study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in't, could you not?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Player</span>: Ay, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him not. My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are welcome to Elsinore.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Good my lord!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ay, so, God buy to you; Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Now I am alone. O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all the visage wanned, Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect, A broken voice, and his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing! For Hecuba! What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do, Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have? He would drown the stage with tears And cleave the general ear with horrid speech, Make mad the guilty and appall the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak, Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause, And can say nothing; no, not for a king, Upon whose property and most dear life A damned defeat was made. Am I a coward? Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across? Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face? Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat, As deep as to the lungs? who does me this? Ha! 'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall To make oppression bitter, or ere this I should ha' fatted all the region kites With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave, That I, the son of a dear father murdered, Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell, Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words, And fall a-cursing, like a very drab, A stallion! Fie upon't! foh! About, my brains! Hum — I have heard That guilty creatures sitting at a play Have by the very cunning of the scene Been struck so to the soul that presently They have proclaimed their malefactions; For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players Play something like the murder of my father Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks; I'll tent him to the quick: if 'a do blench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen May be a devil: and the devil hath power To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps Out of my weakness and my melancholy, As he is very potent with such spirits, Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds More relative than this: the play's the thing Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king. Exit.</p>
      <h2>Act 3, Scene 1</h2>
      <p class="stage">A room in the castle.</p>
      <p class="stage">Enter KING, QUEEN, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and  GUILDENSTERN.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: And can you, by no drift of conference, Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: He does confess he feels himself distracted; But from what cause 'a will by no means speak.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof, When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Did he receive you well?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Most like a gentleman.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: But with much forcing of his disposition.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Niggard of question; but, of our demands, Most free in his reply.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Did you assay him To any pastime?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Madam, it so fell out, that certain players We o'erraught on the way: of these we told him; And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it: they are here about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: 'Tis most true: And he beseeched me to entreat your majesties To hear and see the matter.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: With all my heart; and it doth much content me To hear him so inclined. Good gentlemen, give him a further edge, And drive his purpose into these delights.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: We shall, my lord. Exeunt Rosencranlz and Guildenstern.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Sweet Gertrude, leave us two; For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, That he, as 'twere by accident, may here Affront Ophelia: Her father and myself We'll so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen, We may of their encounter frankly judge, And gather by him, as he is behaved, If't be the affliction of his love or no That thus he suffers for.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: I shall obey you. And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish That your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again, To both your honours.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Madam, I wish it may. Exit Queen.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves. To Ophelia Read on this book; That show of such an exercise may colour Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this, 'Tis too much proved — that with devotion's visage And pious action we do sugar o'er The devil himself.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: O, 'tis too true! How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience! The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art, Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word: O heavy burden!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: I hear him coming: withdraw, my lord. Exeunt King and Polonius. Enter HAMLET.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause: there's the respect That makes calamity of so long life; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office and the spurns That patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The undiscovered country from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all; And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pitch and moment With this regard their currents turn awry, And lose the name of action. — Soft you now! The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins remembered.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Good my lord, How does your honour for this many a day?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I humbly thank you; well, well, well.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: My lord, I have remembrances of yours, That I have longed long to redeliver; I pray you, now receive them.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: No, not I; I never gave you aught.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: My honoured lord, you know right well you did; And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed As made these things more rich: their perfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind. There, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ha, ha! are you honest?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: My lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Are you fair?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: What means your lordship?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you not.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: I was the more deceived.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me: I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: At home, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: O, help him, you sweet heavens!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go, and quickly too. Farewell.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Heavenly powers, restore him!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I have heard of your paintings well enough; God hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig and amble, and you lisp, you nickname God's creatures, and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriage: those that are married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown! The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword; The expectation and rose of the fair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, The observed of all observers, quite, quite down! And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, That sucked the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled, out of time and harsh; That unmatched form and stature of blown youth Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me, To have seen what I have seen, see what I see! Re-enter KING and POLONIUS.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Love! his affections do not that way tend; Nor what he spake, though it lacked form a little, Was not like madness. There's something in his soul, o'er which his melancholy sits on brood; And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger: which for to prevent, I have in quick determination Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England, For the demand of our neglected tribute: Haply the seas and countries different With variable objects shall expel This something-settled matter in his heart, Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus From fashion of himself. What think you on't?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: It shall do well: but yet do I believe The origin and commencement of his grief Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia! You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said; We heard it all. My lord, do as you please; But, if you hold it fit, after the play Let his queen-mother all alone entreat him To show his grief: let her be round with him; And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear Of all their conference. If she find him not, To England send him, or confine him where Your wisdom best shall think.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: It shall be so: Madness in great ones must not unwatched go. Exeunt.</p>
      <h2>Act 3, Scene 2</h2>
      <p class="stage">A hall in the castle.</p>
      <p class="stage">Enter HAMLET and Players.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Player</span>: I warrant your honour.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it makes the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of which one must in your allowance o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men and not made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Player</span>: I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too; though, in the meantime, some necessary question of the play be then to be considered: that's villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready. How now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: And the queen too, and that presently.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Bid the players make haste. Will you two help to hasten them?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</span>: Ay, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What ho! Horatio!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Here, sweet lord, at your service.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man As e'er my conversation coped withal.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: O, my dear lord,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Nay, do not think I flatter; For what advancement may I hope from thee That no revenue hast but thy good spirits, To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flattered? No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp, And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear? Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice And could of men distinguish her election, Sh' hath sealed thee for herself; for thou hast been As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing, A man that fortune's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those Whose blood and judgement are so well commeddled, That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger To sound what stop she please. Give me that man That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart, As I do thee. — Something too much of this. There is a play to-night before the king; One scene of it comes near the circumstance Which I have told thee of my father's death: I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot, Even with the very comment of thy soul Observe my uncle: if his occulted guilt Do not itself unkennel in one speech, It is a damned ghost that we have seen, And my imaginations are as foul As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note; For I mine eyes will rivet to his face, And after we will both our judgements join In censure of his seeming.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Well, my lord: If 'a steal aught the whilst this play is playing, And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: They are coming to the play; I must be idle: Get you a place.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: How fares our cousin Hamlet?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: No, nor mine now. My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What did you enact?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the Capitol; Brutus killed me.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the players ready?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: O, ho! do you mark that?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Lady, shall I lie in your lap?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: No, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I mean, my head upon your lap?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Ay, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Do you think I meant country matters?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: I think nothing, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: What is, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Nothing.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: You are merry, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Who, I?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Ay, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within's two hours.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet! Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year: but, by'r lady, 'a must build churches, then; or else shall 'a suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is “ For, O, for O, the hobby-horse is forgot.”</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: What means this, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Marry, this' miching malicho; it means mischief.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Belike this show imports the argument of the play.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they'll tell all.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Will 'a tell us what this show meant?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ay, or any show that you will show him: be not you ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Prologue</span>: For us, and for our tragedy, Here stooping to your clemency, We beg your hearing patiently. Exit.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: 'Tis brief, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: As woman's love.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Player King</span>: Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground, And thirty dozen moons with borrowed sheen About the world have times twelve thirties been, Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands Unite commutual in most sacred bands.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Player Queen</span>: So many journeys may the sun and moon Make us again count o'er ere love be done! But, woe is me, you are so sick of late, So far from cheer and from your former state, That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust, Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must: For women's fear and love hold quantity; In neither aught, or in extremity. Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know; And as my love is sized, my fear is so: Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear; Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Player King</span>: 'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too; My operant powers their functions leave to do: And thou shalt live in this fair world behind, Honoured, beloved; and haply one as kind For husband shalt thou</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Player Queen</span>: O, confound the rest! Such love must needs be treason in my breast: In second husband let me be accurst! None wed the second but who killed the first.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: That's wormwood.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Player Queen</span>: The instances that second marriage move Are base respects of thrift, but none of love: A second time I kill my husband dead, When second husband kisses me in bed.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Player King</span>: I do believe you think what now you speak; But what we do determine oft we break. Purpose is but the slave to memory, Of violent birth, but poor validity: Which now, the fruit unripe, sticks on the tree; But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be. Most necessary 'tis that we forget To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt: What to ourselves in passion we propose, The passion ending, doth the purpose lose. The violence of either grief or joy Their own enactures with themselves destroy: Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament; Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident. This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange That even our loves should with our fortunes change; For 'tis a question left us yet to prove, Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love. The great man down, you mark his favourite flies; The poor advanced makes friends of enemies, And hitherto doth love on fortune tend; For who not needs shall never lack a friend, And who in want a hollow friend doth try, Directly seasons him his enemy. But, orderly to end where I begun, Our wills and fates do so contrary run That our devices still are overthrown; Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own: So think thou wilt no second husband wed; But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Player Queen</span>: Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light! Sport and repose lock from me day and night! To desperation turn my trust and hope! An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope! Each opposite that blanks the face of joy Meet what I would have well and it destroy! Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife, If, once a widow, ever I be wife!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: If she should break it now!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Player King</span>: 'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile; My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile The tedious day with sleep. Sleeps.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Player Queen</span>: Sleep rock thy brain; And never come mischance between us twain! Exit.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Madam, how like you this play?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: The lady doth protest too much, methinks.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O, but she'll keep her word.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the world.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: What do you call the play?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke's name; his wife, Baptista; you shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what of that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our withers are unwrung. This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: You are as good as a chorus, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets dallying.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: You are keen, my lord, you are keen.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: It would cost you a groaning to take off mine edge.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Still better, and worse.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: So you mistake your husbands. Begin, murderer; leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come: “ the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.”</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Lucianus</span>: Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing; Confederate season, else no creature seeing; Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected, With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected, Thy natural magic and dire property, On wholesome life usurps immediately. Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: 'A poisons him i' the garden for his estate. His name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and written in very choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: The king rises.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What, frighted with false fire!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: How fares my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Give o'er the play.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Give me some light: away!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">All</span>: Lights, lights, lights!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers if the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me with two Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Half a share.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: A whole one, I.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: You might have rhymed.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand pound. Didst perceive?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Very well, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Upon the talk of the poisoning?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: I did very well note him.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ah, ha! come, some music! come, the recorders! Come, some music!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Sir, a whole history.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: The king, sir,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ay, sir, what of him?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: With drink, sir?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: No, my lord, with choler.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to the doctor; for, for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into more choler.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and start not so wildly from my affair.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I am tame, sir: pronounce.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: You are welcome.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do your mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return shall be the end of my business.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Sir, I cannot.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: What, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased; but, sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command; or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Then thus she says; your behaviour hath struck her into amazement and admiration.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration? Impart.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you go to bed.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any further trade with us?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: My lord, you once did love me.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: And do still, by these pickers and stealers.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if you deny your griefs to your friend.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Sir, I lack advancement.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself for your succession in Denmark?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ay, sir, but “ While the grass grows,” the proverb is something musty. O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with you: why do you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me into a toil?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: My lord, I cannot.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I pray you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: Believe me, I cannot.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I do beseech you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: I know no touch of it, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: It is as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your fingers and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I have not the skill.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to the top of my compass: and there is much music, excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you fret me, yet you cannot play upon me. God bless you, sir!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Methinks it is like a weasel.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: It is backed like a weasel.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Or like a whale?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: Very like a whale.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: I will say so.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: By and by is easily said. Leave me, friends. 'Tis now the very witching time of night, When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood, And do such bitter business as the day Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother. O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom: Let me be cruel, not unnatural: I will speak daggers to her, but use none; My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites; How in my words soever she be shent, To give them seals never, my soul, consent! Exit.</p>
      <h2>Act 3, Scene 3</h2>
      <p class="stage">A room in the castle.</p>
      <p class="stage">Enter KING, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: I like him not, nor stands it safe with us To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you; I your commission will forthwith dispatch, And he to England shall along with you: The terms of our estate may not endure Hazard so near's as doth hourly grow Out of his brows.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: We will ourselves provide: Most holy and religious fear it is To keep those many many bodies safe That live and feed upon your majesty.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: The single and peculiar life is bound, With all the strength and armour of the mind, To keep itself from noyance; but much more That spirit upon whose weal depends and rests The lives of many. The cess of majesty Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw What's near it with it; or it is a massy wheel, Fixed on the summit of the highest mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortised and adjoined; which, when it falls, Each small annexment, petty consequence, Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage; For we will fetters put about this fear, Which now goes too free-footed.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz and Guildenstern</span>: We will haste us. Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Enter POLONIUS.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: My lord, he's going to his mother's closet: Behind the arras I'll convey myself, To hear the process; I'll warrant she'll tax him home: And, as you said, and wisely was it said, 'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother, Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege: I'll call upon you ere you go to bed, And tell you what I know.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Thanks, dear my lord. Exit Polonius. O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven; It hath the primal eldest curse upon't, A brother's murder. Pray can I not, Though inclination be as sharp as will: My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent; And, like a man to double business bound, I stand in pause where I shall first begin, And both neglect. What if this cursed hand Were thicker than itself with brother's blood, Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy But to confront the visage of offence? And what's in prayer but this twofold force, To be forestalled ere we come to fall, Or pardoned being down? Then I'll look up; My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer Can serve my turn? “ Forgive me my foul murder ”? That cannot be; since I am still possessed Of those effects for which I did the murder, My crown, mine own ambition and my queen. May one be pardoned and retain the offence? In the corrupted currents of this world Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice, And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above; There is no shuffling, there the action lies In his true nature; and we ourselves compelled, Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults, To give in evidence. What then? what rests? Try what repentance can: what can it not? Yet what can it when one can not repent? O wretched state! O bosom black as death! O limed soul, that, struggling to be free, Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay! Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel, Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe! All may be well. Retires and kneels. Enter HAMLET.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Now might I do it pat, now 'a is a-praying; And now I'll do't. And so 'a goes to heaven; And so am I revenged. That would be scanned: A villain kills my father; and for that, I, his sole son, do this same villain send To heaven. Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge. 'A took my father grossly, full of bread; With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May; And how his audit stands who knows save heaven? But in our circumstance and course of thought. 'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged, To take him in the purging of his soul, When he is fit and seasoned for his passage? No! Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent: When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage, Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed; At game, a-swearing, or about some act That has no relish of salvation in't; Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven, And that his soul may be as damned and black As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays: This physic but prolongs thy sickly days. Exit.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: My words fly up, my thoughts remain below: Words without thoughts never to heaven go. Exit.</p>
      <h2>Act 3, Scene 4</h2>
      <p class="stage">The Queen's closet.</p>
      <p class="stage">Enter QUEEN and POLONIUS.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: 'A will come straight. Look you lay home to him: Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with, And that your grace hath screened and stood between Much heat and him. I'll silence me even here. Pray you, be round.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: I'll warrant you, fear me not. Withdraw, I hear him coming. Polonius hides behind the arras Enter HAMLET.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Now, mother, what's the matter?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Mother, you have my father much offended.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Why, how now, Hamlet!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What's the matter now?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Have you forgot me?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: No, by the rood, not so: You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife; And — would it were not so! — you are my mother.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge; You go not till I set you up a glass Where you may see the inmost part of you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me? Help, ho!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: What, ho! help!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead! Makes a pass through the arras.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Polonius</span>: O, I am slain! Falls and dies.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: O me, what hast thou done?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Nay, I know not: Is it the king?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother, As kill a king, and marry with his brother.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: As kill a king!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ay, lady, it was my word. Lifts up the arras and discovers Polonius. Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell! I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune; Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger. Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down, And let me wring your heart; for so I shall, If it be made of penetrable stuff, If damned custom have not brassed it so That it be proof and bulwark against sense.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue In noise so rude against me?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Such an act That blurs the grace and blush of modesty, Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose From the fair forehead of an innocent love And sets a blister there, makes marriage vows As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed As from the body of contraction plucks The very soul, and sweet religion makes A rhapsody of words: heaven's face does glow o'er this solidity and compound mass, With heated visage, as against the doom, Is thought-sick at the act.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Ay me, what act, That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Look here, upon this picture, and on this, The counterfeit presentment of two brothers. See, what a grace was seated on this brow; Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself; An eye like Mars, to threaten and command; A station like the herald Mercury New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill; A combination and a form indeed, Where every god did seem to set his seal, To give the world assurance of a man: This was your husband. Look you now, what follows: Here is your husband; like a mildewed ear, Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes? Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes? You cannot call it love; for at your age The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble, And waits upon the judgement: and what judgement Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have, Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense Is apoplexed; for madness would not err, Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thralled But it reserved some quantity of choice, To serve in such a difference. What devil was't That thus hath cozened you at hoodman-blind? Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all, Or but a sickly part of one true sense Could not so mope. O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell, If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones, To flaming youth let virtue be as wax, And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame When the compulsive ardour gives the charge, Since frost itself as actively doth burn And reason panders will.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: O Hamlet, speak no more: Thou turn'st my eyes into my very soul; And there I see such black and grained spots As will not leave their tinct.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Nay, but to live In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, Stewed in corruption, honeying and making love Over the nasty sty,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: O, speak to me no more; These words, like daggers, enter in my ears; No more, sweet Hamlet!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: A murderer and a villain; A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings; A cutpurse of the empire and the rule, That from a shelf the precious diadem stole, And put it in his pocket!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: No more!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: A king of shreds and patches, Enter Ghost. Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings, You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Alas, he's mad!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Do you not come your tardy son to chide, That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by The important acting of your dread command? O, say!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ghost</span>: Do not forget: this visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. But, look, amazement on thy mother sits: O, step between her and her fighting soul: Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works: Speak to her, Hamlet.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: How is it with you, lady?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Alas, how is't with you, That you do bend your eye on vacancy And with the incorporal air do hold discourse? Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep; And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm, Your bedded hair, like life in excrements, Start up, and stand an end. O gentle son, Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares! His form and cause conjoined, preaching to stones, Would make them capable. Do not look upon me; Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects: then what I have to do Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: To whom do you speak this?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Do you see nothing there?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Nor did you nothing hear?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: No, nothing but ourselves.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why, look you there look, how it steals away! My father, in his habit as he lived! Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal! Exit Ghost.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: This is the very coinage of your brain: This bodiless creation ecstasy Is very cunning in.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ecstasy! My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time, And makes as healthful music: it is not madness That I have uttered: bring me to the test, And I the matter will re-word; which madness Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace, Lay not that flattering unction to your soul, That not your trespass, but my madness speaks: It will but skin and film the ulcerous place, Whiles rank corruption, mining all within, Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven; Repent what's past; avoid what is to come; And do not spread the compost on the weeds, To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue; For in the fatness of these pursy times Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg, Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O, throw away the worser part of it, And live the purer with the other half. Good night: but go not to my uncle's bed; Assume a virtue, if you have it not. That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat, Of habits devil, is angel yet in this, That to the use of actions fair and good He likewise gives a frock or livery, That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night, And that shall lend a kind of easiness To the next abstinence: the next more easy; For use almost can change the stamp of nature, And either... the devil, or throw him out With wondrous potency. Once more, good night: And when you are desirous to be blessed, I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord, Pointing to Polonius. I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so, To punish me with this and this with me, That I must be their scourge and minister. I will bestow him, and will answer well The death I gave him. So, again, good night. I must be cruel, only to be kind: This bad begins and worse remains behind. One word more, good lady.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: What shall I do?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Not this, by no means, that I bid you do: Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed; Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse; And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses, Or paddling in your neck with his damned fingers, Make you to ravel all this matter out, That I essentially am not in madness, But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know; For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise, Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib, Such dear concernings hide? who would do so? No, in despite of sense and secrecy, Unpeg the basket on the house's top, Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape, To try conclusions, in the basket creep, And break your own neck down.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Be thou assured, if words be made of breath, And breath of life, I have no life to breathe What thou hast said to me.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I must to England; you know that?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Alack, I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: There's letters sealed: and my two schoolfellows, Whom I will trust as I will adders fanged, They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way, And marshal me to knavery. Let it work; For 'tis the sport to have the enginer Hoist with his own petar: and't shall go hard But I will delve one yard below their mines, And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet, When in one line two crafts directly meet. This man shall set me packing: I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room. Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you. Good night, mother. Exeunt severally; Hamlet dragging in Polonius.</p>

      <p class="stage">Enter KING, QUEEN, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves: You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them. Where is your son?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Bestow this place on us a little while. Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Ah, mine own lord, what have I seen to-night!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit, Behind the arras hearing something stir, “ Whips out his rapier, cries, “ A rat, a rat!” And, in this brainish apprehension, kills The unseen good old man.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: O heavy deed! It had been so with us, had we been there: His liberty is full of threats to all; To you yourself, to us, to every one. Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answered? It will be laid to us, whose providence Should have kept short, restrained and out of haunt, This mad young man: but so much was our love, We would not understand what was most fit; But, like the owner of a foul disease, To keep it from divulging, let it feed Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: To draw apart the body he hath killed: o'er whom his very madness, like some ore Among a mineral of metals base, Shows itself pure; 'a weeps for what is done.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: O Gertrude, come away! The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch, But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed We must, with all our majesty and skill, Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern! Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN. Friends both, go join you with some further aid: Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain, And from his mother's closet hath he dragged him: Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this. Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends; And let them know, both what we mean to do, And what's untimely done........... Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter, As level as the cannon to his blank, Transports his poisoned shot, may miss our name,</p>

      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: But soft, what noise? who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence And bear it to the chapel.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Do not believe it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Believe what?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: That I can keep your counsel and not mine own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what replication should be made by the son of a king?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Take you me for a sponge, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in the end: he keeps them, like an ape, an apple, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry again.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: I understand you not, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go with us to the king.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body. The king is a thing</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Guildenstern</span>: A thing, my lord!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.</p>

      <p class="stage">Enter KING attended.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: I have sent to seek him, and to find the body. How dangerous is it that this man goes loose! Yet must not we put the strong law on him: He's loved of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their judgement, but their eyes; And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weighed, But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even, This sudden sending him away must seem Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown By desperate appliance are relieved, Or not at all. Enter ROSENCRANTZ. How now! what hath befallen?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Where the dead body is bestowed, my lord, We cannot get from him.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: But where is he?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Rosencrantz</span>: Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: At supper.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: At supper where?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Not where he eats, but where 'a is eaten: a certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service, two dishes, but to one table: that's the end.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Alas, alas!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: What dost thou mean by this?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Where is Polonius?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: In heaven; send thither to see: if your messenger find him not there, seek him i' the other place yourself. But if indeed you find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up the stairs into the lobby.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Go seek him there.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: 'A will stay till you come.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety, Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence With fiery quickness; therefore prepare thyself; The bark is ready, and the wind at help, The associates tend, and every thing is bent For England.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: For England!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Ay, Hamlet.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for England! Farewell, dear mother.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Thy loving father, Hamlet.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is one flesh; so, my mother. Come, for England!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard; Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night: Away! for every thing is sealed and done That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste. Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught As my great power thereof may give thee sense, Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red After the Danish sword, and thy free awe Pays homage to us — thou mayst not coldly set Our sovereign process; which imports at full, By letters congruing to that effect, The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England; For like the hectic in my blood he rages, And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done, How e'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun. Exit.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: How purposed, sir, I pray you?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Captain</span>: Against some part of Poland.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Who commands them, sir?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Captain</span>: The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Goes it against the main of Poland, sir, Or for some frontier?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Captain</span>: Truly to speak, and with no addition, We go to gain a little patch of ground That hath in it no profit but the name. To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it; Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why, then the Polack never will defend it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Captain</span>: Yes, it is already garrisoned.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats Will not debate the question of this straw: This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace, That inward breaks, and shows no cause without Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I'll be with you straight. Go a little before. Exeunt all except Hamlet, How all occasions do inform against me, And spur my dull revenge! What is a man, If his chief good and market of his time Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more. Sure, he that made us with such large discourse, Looking before and after, gave us not That capability and godlike reason To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple Of thinking too precisely on the event, A thought which, quartered, hath but one part wisdom And ever three parts coward, I do not know Why yet I live to say “ This thing's to do;” Sith I have cause and will and strength and means To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me: Witness this army of such mass and charge Led by a delicate and tender prince, Whose spirit with divine ambition puffed Makes mouths at the invisible event, Exposing what is mortal and unsure To all that fortune, death and danger dare, Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great Is not to stir without great argument, But greatly to find quarrel in a straw When honour's at the stake. How stand I then, That have a father killed, a mother stained, Excitements of my reason and my blood, And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see The imminent death of twenty thousand men, That, for a fantasy and trick of fame, Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, Which is not tomb enough and continent To hide the slain? O, from this time forth, My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth! Exit.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker">Gentleman</span>: She is importunate, indeed distract: Her mood will needs be pitied.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: What would she have?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gentleman</span>: She speaks much of her father; says she hears There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart; Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt, That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing, Yet the unshaped use of it doth move The hearers to collection; they yawn at it, And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts; Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them, Indeed would make one think there might be thought, Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: 'Twere good she were spoken with: for she may strew Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Let her come in. Exit Horatio. To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is, Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss: So full of artless jealousy is guilt, It spills itself in fearing to be spilt. Re-enter HORATIO with OPHELIA.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: How do you, pretty lady?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your table!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Conceit upon her father.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Pray let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what it means, say you this:</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Pretty Ophelia!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Indeed without an oath, I'll make an end on't:</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: How long hath she been thus?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot choose but weep, to think they would lay him i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it: and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies; good night, good night.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you. Exit Horatio. O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs All from her father's death — and now behold O Gertrude, Gertrude, When sorrows come, they come not single spies, But in battalions. First, her father slain: Next, your son gone; and he most violent author Of his own just remove: the people muddied, Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers, For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly, In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia Divided from herself and her fair judgement, Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts: Last, and as much containing as all these, Her brother is in secret come from France; Feeds on this wonder, keeps himself in clouds, And wants not buzzers to infect his ear With pestilent speeches of his father's death; Wherein necessity, of matter beggared, Will nothing stick our person to arraign In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this, Like to a murdering-piece, in many places Gives me superfluous death. A noise within.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Alack, what noise is this?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Attend! Where is my Switzers? Let them guard the door. Enter another Gentleman. What is the matter?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gentleman</span>: Save yourself, my lord: The ocean, overpeering of his list, Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste Than young Laertes, in a riotous head, o'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord; And, as the world were now but to begin, Antiquity forgot, custom not known, The ratifiers and props of every word, They cry, “ Choose we: Laertes shall be king:” Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds: “ Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!”</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: How cheerfully on the false trail they cry! O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: The doors are broke. Noise within. Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Danes</span>: No, let's come in.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: I pray you, give me leave.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Danes</span>: We will, we will. They retire without the door.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: I thank you; keep the door. O thou vile king, Give me my father!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Calmly, good Laertes.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard, Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow Of my true mother.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: What is the cause, Laertes, That thy rebellion looks so giant-like? Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person: There's such divinity doth hedge a king, That treason can but peep to what it would, Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes, Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude. Speak, man.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Where is my father?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Dead.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: But not by him,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Let him demand his fill.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with: To hell, allegiance! vows, to the black'st devil! Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit! I dare damnation. To this point I stand, That both the worlds I give to negligence, Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged Most throughly for my father.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Who shall stay you?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: My will, not all the world's: And for my means, I'll husband them so well, They shall go far with little.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Good Laertes, If you desire to know the certainty Of your dear father, is't writ in your revenge, That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe, Winner and loser?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: None but his enemies.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Will you know them then?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms; And like the kind life-rendering pelican, Repast them with my blood.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Why, now you speak Like a good child and a true gentleman. That I am guiltless of your father's death, And am most sensibly in grief for it, It shall as level to your judgement 'pear As day does to your eye.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Danes</span>: Let her come in.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: How now! what noise is that? Re-enter OPHELIA. O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt, Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye! By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight, Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May! Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia! O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits Should be as mortal as an old man's life? Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine, It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing it loves.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: Fare you well, my dove!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge, It could not move thus.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: You must sing “ a-down a-down,” An you call him a-down-a. O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his master's daughter.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: This nothing's more than matter.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray you, love, remember: and there is pansies, that's for thoughts.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue for you; and here's some for me: we may call it herb of grace a' Sundays. You may wear your rue with a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you some violets, but they withered all when my father died: they say 'a made a good end,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Thought and afflictions, passion, hell itself, She turns to favour and to prettiness.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Ophelia</span>: And of all Christians' souls, I pray God. God buy you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Do you see this, O God?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Laertes, I must commune with your grief, Or you deny me right. Go but apart, Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will, And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me: If by direct or by collateral hand They find us touched, we will our kingdom give, Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours, To you in satisfaction; but if not, Be you content to lend your patience to us, And we shall jointly labour with your soul To give it due content.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Let this be so; His means of death, his obscure funeral No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones, No noble rite nor formal ostentation Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth, That I must call't in question.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: So you shall; And where the offence is let the great axe fall. I pray you, go with me. Exeunt.</p>

      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: What are they that would speak with me?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Servant</span>: Seafaring men, sir: they say they have letters for you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Let them come in. Exit Servant. I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet. Enter Sailors.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Sailor</span>: God bless you, sir.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Let him bless thee too.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Sailor</span>: 'A shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you, sir; it came from the ambassador that was bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: “ Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked this, give these fellows some means to the king: they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I have words to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course for England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell. “ He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET. Come, I will give you way for these your letters; And do't the speedier, that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them.</p>
      <h2>Act 4, Scene 7</h2>
      <p class="stage">Another room in the castle.</p>
      <p class="stage">Enter KING and LAERTES.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Now must your conscience my acquittance seal, And you must put me in your heart for friend, Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear, That he which hath your noble father slain Pursued my life.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: It well appears: but tell me Why you proceeded not against these feats, So criminal and so capital in nature, As by your safety, greatness, wisdom, all things else, You mainly were stirred up.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: O, for two special reasons; Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinewed, But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother Lives almost by his looks; and for myself My virtue or my plague, be it either which She is so conjunctive to my life and soul, That, as the star moves not but in his sphere, I could not but by her. The other motive, Why to a public count I might not go, Is the great love the general gender bear him; Who, dipping all his faults in their affection, Work, like the spring that turneth wood to stone, Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows, Too slightly timbered for so loud a wind, Would have reverted to my bow again, But not where I have aimed them.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: And so have I a noble father lost; A sister driven into desperate terms, Whose worth, if praises may go back again, Stood challenger on mount of all the age For her perfections: but my revenge will come.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think That we are made of stuff so flat and dull That we can let our beard be shook with danger And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more: I loved your father, and we love ourself; And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine Enter a Messenger. How now! what news?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Messenger</span>: Letters, my lord, from Hamlet: These to your majesty; this to the queen.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: From Hamlet! who brought them?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Messenger</span>: Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not: They were given me by Claudio; he received them Of him that brought them.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us. “ High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking you pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden and more strange return. “ HAMLET.” What should this mean? Are all the rest come back? Or is it some abuse and no such thing?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Know you the hand?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: 'Tis Hamlet's character. “ Naked!” And in a postscript here, he says “ alone.” Can you devise me?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come; It warms the very sickness in my heart, That I shall live and tell him to his teeth, “ Thus didst thou.”</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: If it be so, Laertes As how should it be so? how otherwise? Will you be ruled by me?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Ay, my lord; So you will not o'errule me to a peace.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: To thine own peace. If he be now returned, As checking at his voyage, and that he means No more to undertake it, I will work him To an exploit, now ripe in my device, Under the which he shall not choose but fall: And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe, But even his mother shall uncharge the practice And call it accident.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: My lord, I will be ruled; The rather, if you could devise it so That I might be the organ.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: It falls right. You have been talked of since your travel much, And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts Did not together pluck such envy from him As did that one, and that, in my regard, Of the unworthiest siege.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: What part is that, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: A very riband in the cap of youth, Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes The light and careless livery that it wears Than settled age his sables and his weeds, Importing health and graveness. Two months since, Here was a gentleman of Normandy: I have seen myself, and served against, the French, And they can well on horseback: but this gallant Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat; And to such wondrous doing brought his horse, As had he been incorpsed and demi-natured With the brave beast: so far he topped my thought, That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks, Come short of what he did.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: A Norman was't?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: A Norman.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Upon my life, Lamord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: The very same.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: I know him well: he is the brooch indeed And gem of all the nation.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: He made confession of you, And gave you such a masterly report For art and exercise in your defence And for your rapier most especial, That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed, If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation, He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye, If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy That he could nothing do but wish and beg Your sudden coming o'er, to play with you. Now, out of this,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: What out of this, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Laertes, was your father dear to you? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Why ask you this?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Not that I think you did not love your father; But that I know love is begun by time; And that I see, in passages of proof, Time qualifies the spark and fire of it. There lives within the very flame of love A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it; And nothing is at a like goodness still; For goodness, growing to a plurisy, Dies in his own too much: that we would do, We should do when we would; for this “ would ” changes And hath abatements and delays as many As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents; And then this “ should ” is like a spendthrift's sigh, That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer: Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake, To show yourself indeed your father's son More than in words?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: To cut his throat i' the church.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize; Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes, Will you do this, keep close within your chamber. Hamlet returned shall know you are come home: We'll put on those shall praise your excellence And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together And wager o'er your heads: he, being remiss, Most generous and free from all contriving, Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease, Or with a little shuffling, you may choose A sword unbated, and in a pass of practice Requite him for your father.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: I will do't: And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword. I bought an unction of a mountebank, So mortal that, but dip a knife in it, Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, Collected from all simples that have virtue Under the moon, can save the thing from death That is but scratched withal: I'll touch my point With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly, It may be death.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Let's further think of this; Weigh what convenience both of time and means May fit us to our shape: if this should fail, And that our drift look through our bad performance, 'Twere better not assayed: therefore this project Should have a back or second, that might hold, If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see: We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't: When in your motion you are hot and dry As make your bouts more violent to that end And that he calls for drink, I'll have preferred him A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping, If he by chance escape your venomed stuck, Our purpose may hold there. Enter QUEEN. But stay, what noise?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: One woe doth tread upon another's heel, So fast they follow: your sister's drowned, Laertes.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Drowned! O, where?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: There is a willow grows askaunt the brook That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream; Therewith fantastic garlands did she make Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples That liberal shepherds give a grosser name, But our cull-cold maids do dead men's fingers call them: There, on the pendent boughs her crownet weeds Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke: When down her weedy trophies and herself Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide; And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up: Which time she chanted snatches of old lauds; As one incapable of her own distress, Or like a creature native and indued Unto that element: but long it could not be Till that her garments, heavy with their drink, Pulled the poor wretch from her melodious lay To muddy death.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Alas, then, she is drowned?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Drowned, drowned.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia, And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet It is our trick; nature her custom holds, Let shame say what it will: when these are gone, The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord: I have a speech a' fire, that fain would blaze, But that this folly drowns it. Exit.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Let's follow, Gertrude: How much I had to do to calm his rage! Now fear I this will give it start again; Therefore let's follow. Exeunt.</p>
      <h2>Act 5, Scene 1</h2>
      <p class="stage">A churchyard.</p>
      <p class="stage">Enter two Clowns, with spades, c.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully seeks her own salvation?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Second Clown</span>: I tell thee she is; therefore make her grave straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Second Clown</span>: Why, 'tis found so.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: It must be “ se offendendo;” it cannot be else. For here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three branches; it is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned herself wittingly.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Second Clown</span>: Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the man; good; if the man go to this water, and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he goes, mark you that; but if the water come to him and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Second Clown</span>: But is this law?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Second Clown</span>: Will you ha' the truth an't? If this had not been a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out a' Christian burial.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that great folk should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves, more than their even-Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam's profession.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Second Clown</span>: Was he a gentleman?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: 'A was the first that ever bore arms.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Second Clown</span>: Why, he had none.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The Scripture says “ Adam digged:” could he dig without arms? I'll put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess thyself</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Second Clown</span>: Go to.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Second Clown</span>: The gallows-maker; for that outlives a thousand tenants.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well; but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the church: argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Second Clown</span>: “ Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?”</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Second Clown</span>: Marry, now I can tell.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: To't.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Second Clown</span>: Mass, I cannot tell.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when you are asked this question next, say “ a grave-maker:” the houses he makes lasts till doomsday. Go, get thee in and fetch me a stoup of liquor.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Has this fellow no feeling of his business, 'a sings in grave-making?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: 'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: </p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if 'twere Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician, which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God, might it not?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: It might, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Or of a courtier; which could say “ Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost thou, sweet lord?” This might be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord such-a-one's horse, when 'a meant to beg it; might it not?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Ay, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade: here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: </p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: There's another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillities, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he suffer this mad knave now to knock him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Not a jot more, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose grave's this, sirrah?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Mine, sir.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine: 'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: 'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away again, from me to you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What man dost thou dig it for?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: For no man, sir.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What woman, then?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: For none, neither.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Who is to be buried in't?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, this three years I have took note of it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he galls his kibe. How long hast thou been grave-maker?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: How long is that since?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it was that very day that young Hamlet was born; he that is mad, and sent into England.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Why, because 'a was mad: 'a shall recover his wits there; or, if 'a do not, 'tis no great matter there.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: 'Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: How came he mad?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Very strangely, they say.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: How strangely?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Faith, e'en with losing his wits.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Upon what ground?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty years.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Faith, if 'a be not rotten before 'a die as we have many pocky corses that will scarce hold the laying in 'a will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why he more than another?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that 'a will keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now; hath lien you i' the earth three and twenty years.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Whose was it?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Nay, I know not.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'a poured a flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was, sir, Yorick's skull, the king's jester.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: This?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Clown</span>: E'en that.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath bore me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell me one thing.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: What's that, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Dost thou think Alexander looked a' this fashion i' the earth?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: E'en so.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: And smelt so? pah!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: E'en so, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander, till 'a find it stopping a bung-hole?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: 'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: Alexander died, Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth to dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel? But soft! but soft awhile: here comes the king, Enter Priests, c. in procession; the
         Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING, QUEEN, their trains, c. The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow? And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken The corse they follow did with desperate hand Fordo it own life: 'twas of some estate. Couch we awhile and mark. Retiring with Horatio.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: What ceremony else?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: That is Laertes, a very noble youth, mark.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: What ceremony else?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Priest</span>: Her obsequies have been as far enlarged As we have warranty: her death was doubtful; And, but that great command o'ersways the order, She should in ground unsanctified been lodged Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers, Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her: Yet here she is allowed her virgin crants, Her maiden strewments and the bringing home Of bell and burial.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Must there no more be done?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Priest</span>: No more be done: We should profane the service of the dead To sing a requiem and such rest to her As to peace-parted souls.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Lay her i' the earth: And from her fair and unpolluted flesh May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest, A ministering angel shall my sister be, When thou liest howling.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What, the fair Ophelia!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Sweets to the sweet: farewell! Scattering flowers. I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife; I thought thy bride-bed to have decked, sweet maid, And not have strewed thy grave.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: O, treble woe Fall ten times treble on that cursed head, Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile, Till I have caught her once more in mine arms: Leaps into the grave. Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead, Till of this flat a mountain you have made, To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head Of blue Olympus.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What is he whose grief Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I, Hamlet the Dane. Leaps into the grave.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: The devil take thy soul! Grappling with him.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Thou pray'st not well. I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat; For, though I am not splenitive and rash, Yet have I in me something dangerous, Which let thy wisdom fear: hold off thy hand.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Pluck them asunder.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Hamlet, Hamlet!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">All</span>: Gentlemen,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Good my lord, be quiet. The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why, I will fight with him upon this theme Until my eyelids will no longer wag.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: O my son, what theme?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers Could not, with all their quantity of love, Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: O, he is mad, Laertes.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: For love of God, forbear him.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: 'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do: Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself? Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile? I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine? To outface me with leaping in her grave? Be buried quick with her, and so will I: And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw Millions of acres on us, till our ground, Singeing his pate against the burning zone, Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth, I'll rant as well as thou.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: This is mere madness: And thus awhile the fit will work on him; Anon, as patient as the female dove, When that her golden couplets are disclosed, His silence will sit drooping.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Hear you, sir; What is the reason that you use me thus? I loved you ever: but it is no matter; Let Hercules himself do what he may, The cat will mew and dog will have his day. Exit.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him. Exit Horatio. To Laertes Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech; We'll put the matter to the present push. Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son. This grave shall have a living monument: An hour of quiet shortly shall we see; Till then, in patience our proceeding be. Exeunt.</p>
      <h2>Act 5, Scene 2</h2>
      <p class="stage">A hall in the castle.</p>
      <p class="stage">Enter HAMLET and HORATIO.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other; You do remember all the circumstance?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Remember it, my lord!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting, That would not let me sleep: methought I lay Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly, And praised be rashness for it, let us know, Our indiscretion sometime serves us well, When our deep plots do pall: and that should learn us There's a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: That is most certain.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Up from my cabin, My sea-gown scarfed about me, in the dark Groped I to find out them; had my desire, Fingered their packet, and in fine withdrew To mine own room again; making so bold, My fears forgetting manners, to unseal Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio, Ah, royal knavery! — an exact command, Larded with many several sorts of reasons Importing Denmark's health and England's too, With ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, That, on the supervise, no leisure bated, No, not to stay the grinding of the axe, My head should be struck off.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Is't possible?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Here's the commission: read it at more leisure. But wilt thou hear now how I did proceed?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: I beseech you.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Being thus be-netted round with villainies — Or I could make a prologue to my brains, They had begun the play — I sat me down, Devised a new commission, wrote it fair: I once did hold it, as our statists do, A baseness to write fair and laboured much How to forget that learning, but, sir, now It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know The effect of what I wrote?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Ay, good my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: An earnest conjuration from the king, As England was his faithful tributary, As love between them like the palm might flourish, As peace should still her wheaten garland wear And stand a comma 'tween their amities, And many such-like “ As'es of great charge, That, on the view and knowing of these contents. Without debatement further, more or less, He should those bearers put to sudden death, Not shriving time allowed.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: How was this sealed?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. I had my father's signet in my purse, Which was the model of that Danish seal; Folded the writ up in the form of the other, Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely, The changeling never known. Now, the next day Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent Thou know'st already.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Why, man, they did make love to this employment; They are not near my conscience; their defeat Does by their own insinuation grow: 'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes Between the pass and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Why, what a king is this!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Does it not, think thee, stand me now upon — He that hath killed my king and whored my mother, Popped in between the election and my hopes, Thrown out his angle for my proper life, And with such cozenage — is't not perfect conscience, To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damned, To let this canker of our nature come In further evil?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: It must be shortly known to him from England What is the issue of the business there.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: It will be short: the interim's mine; And a man's life's no more than to say “ One.” But I am very sorry, good Horatio, That to Laertes I forgot myself; For, by the image of my cause, I see The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours: But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me Into a towering passion.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Peace! who comes here? Enter OSRIC.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: No. my good lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say, spacious in the possession of dirt.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should impart a thing to you from his majesty.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: I thank your lordship, it is very hot.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry, as 'twere, I cannot tell how. My lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that 'a has laid a great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I beseech you, remember</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: Nay, good my lord; for my ease, in good faith. Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft society and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the continent of what part a gentleman would see.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; though, I know, to divide him inventorially would dozy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great article; and his infusion of such dearth and rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more rawer breath?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: Sir?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Is't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will to't, sir, really.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What imports the nomination of this gentleman?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: Of Laertes?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Of him, sir.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: I know you are not ignorant</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not much approve me. Well. sir?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to know himself.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What's his weapon?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: Rapier and dagger.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: That's two of his weapons: but, well.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary horses: against the which he has impawned, as I take it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberal conceit.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: What call you the carriages?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: The phrase would be more germane to the matter, if we could carry a cannon by our sides: I would it might be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their assigns, and three liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet against the Danish. Why is this all “ impawned,” as you call it?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial, if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: How if I answer “ no ”?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty, it is the breathing time of day with me; let the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: Shall I deliver you so?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: I commend my duty to your lordship.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Yours. 'A does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else for's turn.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: 'A did comply, sir, with his dug, before 'a sucked it. Thus has he and many more of the same breed that I know the drossy age dotes on only got the tune of the time and out of an habit of encounter; a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Lord</span>: My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric, who brings back to him, that you attend him in the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Lord</span>: The king and queen and all are coming down.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: In happy time.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Lord</span>: The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: She well instructs me.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: You will lose, my lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I do not think so; since he went into France, I have been in continual practice: I shall win at the odds. Thou wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Nay, good my lord,</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will forestall their repair hither, and say you are not fit.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Not a whit, we defy augury: there is special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all: since no man of aught he leaves knows what is't to leave betimes? Let be.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me. The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Give me your pardon, sir: I have done you wrong; But pardon't, as you are a gentleman. This presence knows, And you must needs have heard, how I am punished With a sore distraction. What I have done, That might your nature, honour and exception Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness. Was't Hamlet wronged Laertes? Never Hamlet: If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away, And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes, Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it. Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wronged; His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy. Sir, in this audience, Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil Free me so far in your most generous thoughts, That I have shot my arrow o'er the house, And hurt my brother.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: I am satisfied in nature, Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most To my revenge: but in my terms of honour I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement, Till by some elder masters, of known honour, I have a voice and precedent of peace, To keep my name ungored. But till that time, I do receive your offered love like love, And will not wrong it.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I embrace it freely; And will this brothers' wager frankly play. Give us the foils. Come on.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Come, one for me.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night, Stick fiery off indeed.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: You mock me, sir.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: No, by this hand.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, You know the wager?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Very well, my lord; Your grace has laid the odds a' the weaker side.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: I do not fear it; I have seen you both: But since he is bettered, we have therefore odds.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: This is too heavy, let me see another.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: This likes me well. These foils have all a length? They prepare to play.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: Ay, my good lord.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Set me the stoups of wine upon that table. If Hamlet give the first or second hit, Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the battlements their ordnance fire; The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath; And in the cup an union shall he throw, Richer than that which four successive kings In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups; And let the kettle to the trumpet speak, The trumpet to the cannoneer without, The cannons to the heavens, the heaven to earth, “ Now the king drinks to Hamlet.” Come, begin: And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Come on, sir.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Come, my lord. They play.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: One.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: No.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Judgement.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: A hit, a very palpable hit.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Well; again.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine; Here's to thy health. Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within. Give him the cup.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come. They play. Another hit; what say you?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: A touch, a touch, I do confess't.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Our son shall win.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: He's fat, and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows: The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Good madam!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Gertrude, do not drink.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: It is the poisoned cup: it is too late.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: Come, let me wipe thy face.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: My lord, I'll hit him now.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: I do not think't.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: And yet it is almost against my conscience.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Come, for the third, Laertes: you do but dally; I pray you, pass with your best violence; I am sure you make a wanton of me.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Say you so? come on. They play.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: Nothing, neither way.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Have at you now! Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they change rapiers, and
         Hamlet wounds Laertes.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: Part them: they are incensed.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Nay, come, again. The Queen falls.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: Look to the queen there, ho!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: How is't, Laertes?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric; I am justly killed with mine own treachery.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: How does the queen?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: She swoons to see them bleed.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Gertrude</span>: No, no, the drink, the drink, O my dear Hamlet, The drink, the drink! I am poisoned. Dies.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O villainy! Ho! let the door be locked: Treachery! Seek it out.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain; No medicine in the world can do thee good; In thee there is not half an hour's life; The treacherous instrument is in thy hand, Unbated and envenomed: the foul practice Hath turned itself on me; lo, here I lie, Never to rise again: thy mother's poisoned: I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: The point envenomed too! Then, venom, to thy work. Stabs the King.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">All</span>: Treason! treason!</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">King</span>: O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane, Drink off this potion. Is thy union here? Follow my mother. King dies.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Laertes</span>: He is justly served; It is a poison tempered by himself. Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet: Mine and my father's death come not upon thee, Nor thine on me! Dies.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, That are but mutes or audience to this act, Had I but time — as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest — O, I could tell you But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest; report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Never believe it: I am more an antique Roman than a Dane: Here's yet some liquor left.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: As th' art a man, Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't. O good Horatio, what a wounded name, Things standing thus unknown, shall I leave behind me If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, Absent thee from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain, To tell my story. March afar off, and shot within. What warlike noise is this?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Osric</span>: Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, To the ambassadors of England gives This warlike volley.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Hamlet</span>: O, I die, Horatio; The potent poison quite o'ercrows my spirit: I cannot live to hear the news from England; But I do prophesy the election lights On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice; So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, Which have solicited. The rest is silence. Dies.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince; And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest! Why does the drum come hither? March within. Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors,
         and others.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Fortinbras</span>: Where is this sight?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: What is it you would see? If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Fortinbras</span>: This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternal cell, That thou so many princes at a shot So bloodily hast struck?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">First Ambassador</span>: The sight is dismal; And our affairs from England come too late: The ears are senseless that should give us hearing, To tell him his commandment is fulfilled, That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead: Where should we have our thanks?</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Not from his mouth, Had it the ability of life to thank you: He never gave commandment for their death. But since, so jump upon this bloody question, You from the Polack wars, and you from England, Are here arrived, give order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view; And let me speak to the yet unknowing world How these things came about: so shall you hear Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, Of accidental judgements, casual slaughters, Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause, And, in this upshot, purposes mistook Fall'n on the inventors' heads: all this can I Truly deliver.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Fortinbras</span>: Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience. For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune: I have some rights of memory in this kingdom, Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Horatio</span>: Of that I shall have also cause to speak, And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more: But let this same be presently performed, Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance, On plots and errors, happen.</p>
      <p><span class="speaker">Fortinbras</span>: Let four captains Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage; For he was likely, had he been put on, To have proved most royal: and, for his passage, The soldiers' music and the rite of war Speak loudly for him. Take up the bodies: such a sight as this Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss. Go, bid the soldiers shoot. A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after
         which a peal of ordnance is shot off.</p>
